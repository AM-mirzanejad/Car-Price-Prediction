# Car Price Prediction and Estimation Project (First Release) üöóüí∞

Welcome to the first release of our Car Price Prediction and Estimation Project, scheduled for April 15th! This project leverages machine learning models to predict and estimate car prices with high accuracy, achieving a prediction error coefficient of less than 1 cent. The model demonstrates exceptional accuracy and reliability, making it a valuable tool for car price estimation.

## About the Project ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This project aims to assist users in predicting car prices based on various features such as manufacturing year, mileage, fuel type, engine power, and more. By utilizing machine learning algorithms like Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting, we've developed a robust model that offers precise car price predictions.

## About Cars and Pricing üöòüíµ

Understanding and predicting car prices can be essential for both buyers and sellers in the automotive industry. Factors such as the car's age, mileage, fuel efficiency, and engine power significantly influence its market value. Our project harnesses these insights to provide accurate estimates of car prices, empowering users with valuable information.

## First Release Details üöÄ

This is the initial release of our project, scheduled for  Monday - 2024 15 April . In this release, you'll find the first version of our car price prediction model, which demonstrates outstanding accuracy and performance. We encourage users to provide feedback and suggestions to further enhance the project in future releases
