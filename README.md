## How to Use the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**: Before running the project, make sure to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:


## How to Use the Project

1. **Dataset**: Start by collecting a comprehensive dataset of car information. This dataset should include important features such as manufacturing year, mileage, fuel type, engine power, etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: After gathering the data, preprocess it. This involves cleaning incomplete data, transforming features into an acceptable format for machine learning models, and performing essential analyses for better data understanding.

3. **Model Selection**: Choosing the right model for predicting car prices is crucial. Consider models like Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting, and train them based on your data.

4. **Model Training**: Train the model using your training data to accurately predict car prices.

5. **Model Evaluation**: After training the model, evaluate how accurate and reliable it is. Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

6. **Using the Model**: Prepare a user interface or use an API for easier utilization of the model to predict car prices.
